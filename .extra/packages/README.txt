Package: sphinxcontrib-ansi
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:License: BSD

This packages seems to be no longer registered in pypi.
The current "setup.py" in the repository has also a problem.
It tries to read "README" instead "README.rst".
Therefore, you cannot install the package from the Mercurial repository.

This problem is fixed in the bundled source distribution.
