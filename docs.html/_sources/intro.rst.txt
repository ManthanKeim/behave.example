Introduction
==============================================================================

Read the Documentation
------------------------

Before you start reading this manual, you should have read the
`behave documentation`_ to understand how :pypi:`behave` works.

.. hint::

    The `cucumber`_ and `jbehave`_ documentation might also be
    interesting for you, if you like to know where certain concepts originate.


Given, When, Then
------------------------

You should understand the :term:`BDD` concepts.

.. code-block:: gherkin

    Feature: Title (one line describing the story/feature)

        As a    [role]
        I want  [feature]
        So that [benefit]

        Scenario: Title1 (for Behaviour 1)

            Given [context or setup]
            And  [some more context]...
            When [event occurs]
            Then [expected outcome]
            And  [another outcome]...

        Scenario: Title2 (for Behaviour 2)
            ...



Select an Assertion Matcher Library
-----------------------------------------

Before you start to use :pypi:`behave` (or any other :term:`BDD` framework)
you should select an assertion matcher library that you want to use
in your project.

Python has a growing number of assertion *matcher libraries* by now.
Here is the list of some of these:

======================= ===============================================================
Matcher Library         Description
======================= ===============================================================
Native assert           Starting point, but not enough information when assert fails.
`hamcrest`_             First assertion matcher library, now part of `JUnit4`_.
                        Supports several programming languages:
                        :github:`hamcrest/PyHamcrest`
:pypi:`behave-pytest`   Enables `pytest`_ assertions in behave:
                        :github:`ribozz/behave-pytest`
`nose.tools`_           Part of the :pypi:`nose` test framework
`should-dsl`_           An interesting small matcher library,
                        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/should_dsl
:pypi:`sure`            Provided by the maker of :pypi:`lettuce`,
                        :github:`gabrielfalcao/sure`
:pypi:`compare`         https://pypi.python.org/pypi/compare
:pypi:`describe`        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/describe
======================= ===============================================================

.. note::

    `hamcrest`_ is used as *assertion matcher library* in the examples
    presented here.
